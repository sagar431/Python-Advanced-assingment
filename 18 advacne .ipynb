    "Q1. Text files contain textual data and are usually human-readable, while binary files contain non-textual data and are not human-readable. Text files are encoded using a specific character encoding such as ASCII or Unicode, while binary files are not encoded and contain data in a raw format. Text files can be opened and edited using any text editor, while binary files require special software to read and edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Text files are best suited for storing human-readable data, such as configuration files, log files, and text documents. Binary files are best suited for storing non-textual data, such as images, videos, and executable files. Text files are also preferred when the size of the file is relatively small, and human readability is a priority. Binary files are preferred when the size of the file is large, and efficient storage and access are a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. One of the issues with using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disc is that different computer architectures may have different byte orders, which can cause compatibility issues when transferring data between machines. Another issue is that the size of the integer may vary between different versions of Python or different platforms, which can lead to data corruption or truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The with keyword provides a more concise and safer way to open and close files. It automatically takes care of closing the file when the block inside the with statement is exited, even if an exception is raised. This ensures that resources are properly released and prevents file leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. When reading a line of text, Python includes the trailing newline character if it exists. When writing a line of text, Python does not automatically append a newline character unless explicitly specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Random-access operations can be performed using the seek() and tell() methods. The seek() method allows the file pointer to be moved to a specific position in the file, while the tell() method returns the current position of the file pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. The struct package is used to pack and unpack binary data into a specific format. It is commonly used when working with binary file formats, network protocols, and low-level programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Pickling is the best option when you need to serialize complex Python objects into a byte stream for storage or transmission. It is useful for caching, object persistence, and interprocess communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. The shelve package provides a persistent dictionary-like object that can be used to store and retrieve data from a disk file. It is useful for storing large amounts of data that would not fit in memory and can be accessed in a random-access manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. A special restriction when using the shelve package is that the keys must be strings, while the values can be any pickleable Python object. This is because the shelve module uses the keys to generate filenames on disk."
