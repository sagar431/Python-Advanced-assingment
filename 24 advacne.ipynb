    "A1. It is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module, and the goal would be to access different parts of the module using different import statements. For example, you might import a module once to access its classes and another time to access its functions. One situation where it would be beneficial is if you want to reduce the amount of code you need to write to access different parts of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "A2. Some characteristics of a module in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a file containing Python code.\n",
    "- It can define functions, classes, and variables.\n",
    "- It can be imported and used in other Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A3. To avoid mutual importing, you can restructure your program so that the modules are not dependent on each other. One way to do this is to create a third module that both modules can import and use to share information. Another way is to refactor the modules so that the circular dependency is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A4. The __all__ variable in Python is used to specify which symbols from a module should be imported when a user imports the module using the from module import * syntax. By default, only names that do not begin with an underscore are imported. The __all__ variable allows the module author to specify additional names to be imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "A5. It is useful to refer to the __name__ attribute or the string '__main__' when you want to determine whether a Python module is being run as the main program or being imported as a module into another program. This is commonly used to create code that can be run both as a standalone program and as a module in another program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A6. Attaching a program counter to an RPN interpreter application provides several benefits, including the ability to track the current position in the RPN script, to allow for debugging, and to improve performance by avoiding the need to repeatedly parse the script from the beginning.\n",

    "A7. To render a basic programming language like RPN primitive but complete, you would need at least the following expressions and statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A way to define and manipulate variables.\n",
    "- A way to perform arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
    "- A way to handle conditional statements, such as if-then-else statements.\n",
    "- A way to handle looping statements, such as for and while loops.\n",
