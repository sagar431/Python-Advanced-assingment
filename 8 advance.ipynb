    "Q1. The two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.x are:\n",
    "- `BaseException` can no longer be used as a base class for user-defined exceptions.\n",
    "- Exception chaining can now be done explicitly with the `raise X from Y` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. When a class-based exception is raised, Python looks for a matching exception handler. It searches the call stack, starting from the current function and moving up to higher-level functions, until it finds a matching `except` block. If no matching handler is found, the program terminates and prints a traceback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Two methods for attaching context information to exception artifacts are:\n",
    "- Adding an argument to the exception constructor that captures context information, such as a filename or line number.\n",
    "- Using the `raise X from Y` syntax to attach an exception chain to the original exception, where `Y` is the original exception that caused `X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Two methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message are:\n",
    "- Adding an argument to the exception constructor that specifies the error message, such as `raise ValueError('Invalid argument')`.\n",
    "- Defining a `__str__` method in the exception class that returns the error message, such as `def __str__(self): return 'Invalid argument'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. String-based exceptions have been deprecated in Python because they are less flexible and less powerful than class-based exceptions. String-based exceptions are also less consistent with Python's object-oriented philosophy, as they do not allow for the creation of custom exception classes with their own behavior and attributes. Class-based exceptions, on the other hand, provide a more structured and consistent approach to handling errors and allow for greater flexibility and customization."
