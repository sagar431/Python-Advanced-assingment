    "Q1. The assignment operator like += is not just for show. It can lead to faster results at runtime, especially when working with large data sets, as it modifies the existing object in place instead of creating a new one.\n",

    "Q5. To print a multidimensional list efficiently in IDLE, you can use a nested for loop to iterate through each element and print it on a new line. For example:\n",

    "Q8. In Python, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and stored in variables. This allows for powerful functional programming techniques and makes it easier to write reusable and modular code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. A wrapper is a function or class that provides a simple and consistent interface to a complex or non-standard feature. A wrapped feature is the complex or non-standard feature that is being wrapped. A decorator is a special kind of wrapper that modifies the behavior of a function or class without changing its source code.\n",

    "Q10. If a function is a generator function in Python, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator that can be used to iterate over a potentially infinite sequence of values. Generator functions use the yield statement to return values one at a time, and the state of the function is saved between calls so that it can resume where it left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. The one improvement that must be made to a function in order for it to become a generator function in Python is to replace the return statement with a yield statement. The yield statement allows the function to return a value without actually exiting, and the state of the function is saved so that it can be resumed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. One benefit of generators is that they can be used to generate potentially infinite sequences of values without using excessive memory or causing the program to crash. They also allow for lazy evaluation, which means that values are only generated as needed, reducing processing time and memory usage. Generators are also highly modular and can be easily combined and reused in different parts of a program."
